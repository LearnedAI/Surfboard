# Development Environment Setup

## Environment Analysis (January 2025)

### Current System Status
- **Platform**: Linux (WSL2) on Windows
- **Chrome**: Version 138.0.7204.183 ✅ (Exceeds minimum requirement of Chrome 64+)
- **Python**: 3.12.3 ✅
- **Node.js**: v23.11.1 ✅
- **.NET**: Not installed ❌

### Technology Stack Decision

Based on the specification research and current environment, **we're making a strategic pivot**:

#### **Recommendation: Python-based Implementation**

**Rationale:**
1. **Cross-platform Development**: Current WSL2 environment suggests cross-platform development needs
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Python enables faster POC development for Phase 0
3. **Rich Ecosystem**: Excellent libraries for WebSocket, CDP, and automation
4. **LLM Integration**: Superior ecosystem for LLM communication and JSON handling
5. **Future Flexibility**: Can create Windows-specific components later if needed

#### **Core Technology Stack:**

```
Language: Python 3.12+
WebSocket: websockets or aiohttp
CDP Client: pychrome or custom asyncio implementation
HTTP Server: FastAPI for REST API
UI Automation: pyautogui + custom Win32 bindings when needed
Build System: Poetry for dependency management
Testing: pytest + asyncio testing
Documentation: mkdocs
```

### **IMPORTANT ROADMAP ADJUSTMENT**

**Finding**: The specification assumes Windows-native C#/.NET development, but our environment suggests a Python-first approach would be more practical for:

1. **Faster POC development** in Phase 0
2. **Better LLM integration libraries**
3. **Cross-platform compatibility** 
4. **Easier CDP protocol implementation**

**Proposed Roadmap Update**: 
- Phase 0: Python-based POCs and core functionality
- Phase 1-2: Python implementation with Windows API bindings
- Phase 3+: Consider native Windows components if performance requires it

### Development Environment Requirements

#### Immediate Setup Needed:
- [ ] Python virtual environment with Poetry
- [ ] WebSocket testing tools
- [ ] Chrome with debugging flags
- [ ] Basic CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions)

#### Windows-Specific Requirements (Future):
- Windows SDK 10.0.26100 (when we add native Windows components)
- Visual Studio 2022 (if we need C++ components)
- Code signing certificate (for production UIAccess)

### Next Steps

1. Set up Python development environment
2. Create initial CDP connection test in Python
3. Test Chrome debugging port functionality
4. Benchmark Python vs native performance for critical paths

**Note**: This represents a significant but justified deviation from the original roadmap's assumption of Windows-native development.
