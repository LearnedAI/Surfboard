# Surfboard - Windows Chrome Automation Bridge

A native Windows automation bridge that enables LLMs to control Google Chrome through intelligent protocol selection, providing secure, performant, and reliable browser automation specifically optimized for AI-driven interactions.

## Project Vision

Build a production-ready automation bridge that combines Windows UI Automation with Chrome DevTools Protocol, WebDriver, and Native Messaging to create the most flexible and secure browser automation platform for LLM interactions.

## Core Principles

- **Security First**: Every feature must pass security review before implementation
- **Protocol Agnostic**: Support multiple automation methods, selecting the best for each task
- **LLM Optimized**: Design APIs and responses specifically for LLM consumption
- **Production Ready**: Build for reliability, monitoring, and enterprise deployment
- **Extensible Architecture**: Enable plugin system for custom capabilities

## Architecture Overview

Surfboard implements a layered architecture:

- **Core Layer**: Win32 APIs for window discovery and management
- **Automation Layer**: Windows UI Automation for application interaction
- **Browser Layer**: Chrome DevTools Protocol, WebDriver, and Extensions API
- **Communication Layer**: WebSocket server optimized for LLM interaction
- **Security Layer**: Sandboxing, authentication, and audit logging
