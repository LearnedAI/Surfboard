# Surfboard Development Roadmap

## Project Vision
Build a native Windows automation bridge that enables LLMs to control Google Chrome through intelligent protocol selection, providing secure, performant, and reliable browser automation specifically optimized for AI-driven interactions.

## Core Principles
- **Security First**: Every feature must pass security review before implementation
- **Protocol Agnostic**: Support multiple automation methods, selecting the best for each task
- **LLM Optimized**: Design APIs and responses specifically for LLM consumption
- **Production Ready**: Build for reliability, monitoring, and enterprise deployment
- **Extensible Architecture**: Enable plugin system for custom capabilities

## Phase 0: Foundation & Planning (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish project structure and validate core technical approaches

### Environment Setup
- [x] Create project repository with proper .gitignore and README
