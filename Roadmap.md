# Surfboard Development Roadmap

## Project Vision
Build a native Windows automation bridge that enables LLMs to control Google Chrome through intelligent protocol selection, providing secure, performant, and reliable browser automation specifically optimized for AI-driven interactions.

## Core Principles
- **Security First**: Every feature must pass security review before implementation
- **Protocol Agnostic**: Support multiple automation methods, selecting the best for each task
- **LLM Optimized**: Design APIs and responses specifically for LLM consumption
- **Production Ready**: Build for reliability, monitoring, and enterprise deployment
- **Extensible Architecture**: Enable plugin system for custom capabilities

---

## Phase 0: Foundation & Planning (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish project structure and validate core technical approaches

### Environment Setup
- [x] Create project repository with proper .gitignore and README
- [x] Set up development environment with Windows SDK and Chrome
- [x] Configure build system (Poetry for Python - **TECHNOLOGY STACK CHANGE**)
- [x] Establish coding standards and documentation practices
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline skeleton
- [x] **COMPLETE**: Install all dependencies (Poetry 2.1.4, 111+ packages)
- [x] **COMPLETE**: Configure git with credentials and pre-commit hooks
- [x] **COMPLETE**: Initial commit and push to GitHub repository

**MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL DECISION**: Switched from C#/.NET to Python for implementation
- **Rationale**: Current WSL2/Linux environment, faster prototyping, better LLM integration
- **Impact**: Changed build system from CMake/MSBuild to Poetry
- **Benefits**: Faster Phase 0 POCs, rich ecosystem for automation and AI integration
- **Future Path**: Can add native Windows components later if performance requires

### Technical Proof of Concepts
- [x] Create minimal CDP connection test (validate WebSocket communication)
- [x] Build simple UI Automation element finder (validate Windows integration)
- [x] Test Chrome launch with debugging port enabled
- [x] Verify Native Messaging protocol with dummy extension
- [ ] Benchmark latency for different communication methods

**POC PROGRESS UPDATE**:
- ‚úÖ **CDP Client**: Complete Python implementation with async WebSocket communication
- ‚úÖ **Chrome Manager**: Browser lifecycle management with proper debugging flags
- ‚úÖ **Test Framework**: Comprehensive unit tests with mocking and integration test patterns
- ‚úÖ **INTEGRATION VERIFIED**: Real Chrome automation working (headless launch, CDP communication, JavaScript execution)
- ‚úÖ **Development Environment**: Poetry, dependencies, git, pre-commit hooks, linting all functional
- ‚úÖ **Windows UI Automation**: Cross-platform desktop automation with Windows/Linux/macOS support
- ‚è≥ **Native Messaging**: Protocol verification with dummy extension (final POC)
- ‚è≥ **Latency Benchmarking**: Performance measurement across protocols
